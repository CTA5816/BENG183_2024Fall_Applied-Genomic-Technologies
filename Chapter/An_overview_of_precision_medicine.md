### 1. Definition of Precision Medicine
Precision Medicine is an emerging approach for treatment that aims to improve the overall outcome of treatment for patients with various diseases.

The Precision Medicine Initiative[[1](https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/primer/precisionmedicine/definition)] defines precision medicine as a treatment approach that takes into account a patient's gene, environment, and lifestyle in order to formulate a treatment that is more precise to their form of the disease that would also work for a small population that share that similar form of disease.

The image below illustrates a general diagram [[2](https://getreferralmd.com/2018/02/precision-medicine-can-help-fix-healthcare/)] of how precision medicine can provide a custom treatment that can be applied to a smaller population experiencing a similar form of the disease rather than a general treatment for the disease.

### 2. Difference between Personalized Medicine and Precision Medicine

**Personalized Medicine**

Personalized Medicine is providing individualized treatment for a patient. This includes not only the drug itself, but also the dosage and regime that goes into administrating the drug. Though this treatment approach would hypothetically yield the best results, it is neither practical nor efficient for the medical industry to approach every single patient with personalized medicine.

**Precision Medicine**

Precision Medicine is a step towards personalized medicine as it utilizes more variables in order to categorize patients to provide the optimal treatment. However, it does not develop a completely individualized treatment for the patient. Though each patient is unique in their own way, the patient's form of disease may closely resemble that of other individuals with the disease. Thus, developing a drug and regime that can treat a small population rather than on the individual level would be much more time efficient and cost effective.[[3](https://www.plengegen.com/wp-content/uploads/4_Toward-Precision-Medicine.pdf)]

### 3. The Cycle of Precision Medicine

As shown in the diagram [[4](http://nas-sites.org/ilar-roundtable/files/2017/10/HOOK-BARNARD-NAS-PM-history-Animal-models_10-5-17v2.pdf)], precision medicine functions in a cycle as we are constantly learning new information about the genome, our environment, and medicine. As medical technologies become more advanced and accessible, we are able to gain more knowledge for disease diagnosis, treatment, and prevention. Starting from a large population, we can break down the group into individuals. From the individual, we can utilize genomic sequencing technologies and everyday lifestyle trackers to contribute to a “Knowledge Network” where scientists and doctors are able to derive information that would enable patients to develop more precise diagnostics, treatments, and prevention for a disease. This will bring us back to the categorized large population which these medical developments would be utilized.

#### 4. Technology in Precision Medicine
Once we get to the individual level, the first step of precision medicine would be to gather genomic data. This is done so by using next-generation sequencing, or NGS. NGS technologies allow us to better understand disease development and patient characteristics which are important factors when determining which form of a certain treatment would be better suited for a patient with that disease. NGS technologies produce vast amounts of data, so the next step would be expanding our knowledge and ability to take advantage of all the information NGS can provide and apply it to precision medicine [[11](https://www.healthcatalyst.com/real-opportunity-precision-medicine)].

### 5. Examples of Precision Medicine
**Cancer**

Oncology is one of the major fields where precision medicine is utilized. While tumors are similar in that they are caused by uncontrollable cell division, they differ in location, aggressiveness, and weakness.
For example, breast cancer is mainly caused by mutations in one of the following aspects: estrogen receptors, HER-2 gene, or BRCA1/BRCA2 gene. There is a lot of variability in treatment across these three mutations, even within each mutation. This is why understanding the tumor's epigenetic markers and genetic data would enable scientists to develop more precise forms of treatment [[5](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1VD0KbnLThYzqJ9eN6EWcOhd5i726QfYc8KnCt7bUhPM/edit#slide=id.g404a8c7ebe_0_603)].

**Cystic Fibrosis**

Another disease that benefits from precision medicine is Cystic Fibrosis. Cystic Fibrosis is a disease that can be caused by more than 2000 known mutations linked to the Cystic Fibrosis Transmembrane Conductance Regulator (CFTR) protein. Scientists have been able to categorize these mutations into six major subgroups based on CFTR function and expression levels (see diagram above [[6](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fphar.2016.00275/full)]). Currently, the precision medicine approach allows doctors to treat 60% of CF cases. As our understanding of the CFTR mutations improve, we are able to develop more precise treatments for CF patients to improve quality of life and life expectancy [[7](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1526054217300246)].

### 6. Challenges Facing Precision Medicine
**1. Cost**

Genomic sequencing technologies and drug development are expensive aspects of precision medicine. Due to the high cost and experimental nature, insurance companies may not accept precision medicine treatments when the more general treatment approach is available.

**2. Privacy**

Precision medicine relies on collection of genomic data from large populations of people in order to categorize their disease into smaller population to develop more precise diagnostic, treatment, and prevention approaches. This would require personal genomic data being shared while still maintaining a certain degree of patient privacy and confidentiality.

**3. Data Storage**

A full human genome can take up to 200 GB of storage. Many research facilities and hospitals don't have the means to store large amounts of data required for precision medicine [[8](https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/primer/precisionmedicine/challenges)].

### 7. The Future of Precision Medicine
Today, there are still many challenges facing precision medicine. However, it is considered the future for diagnosis, treatment, and prevention, and organizations in power are making sure of it.

  * IBM Watson has invested $200 million into Watson's automated system that would essentially take in a patient's genome and suggest optimal treatment options [[2](https://getreferralmd.com/2018/02/precision-medicine-can-help-fix-healthcare/)].

  * Pfizer, a large pharmaceutical company, is focusing one of their main Research and Development projects on precision medicine, and have partnered with 23&me for accessing genomic data [[9](https://www.pfizer.com/science/research-development/precision-medicine)].

  * Part of China's 15 year plan is to invest $9.2 billion into their Precision Medicine Initiative by 2030 [[10](http://www.bioworld.com/content/china-initiative-would-pour-billions-precision-medicine-0)].
