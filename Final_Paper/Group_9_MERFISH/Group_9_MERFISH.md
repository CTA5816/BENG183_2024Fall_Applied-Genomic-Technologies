## Procedure

## Computational Decoding

## Output
#### Expression Noise
#### Expression Covariation
#### Spatial Distribution

## Applications of MERFISH
#### Developmental Biology
- **Tissue Morphogenesis**: MERFISH reveals how gene expression drives the formation and differentiation of tissues during embryonic development.**: Normalize data to ensure each feature contributes equally to variance.  
- **Cell Lineage Tracing**: It enables the study of how single cells contribute to tissue formation, providing a spatial view of developmental trajectories.
#### Cancer Research
- **Tumor Microenvironment**: MERFISH maps gene expression in tumor and surrounding stromal cells, providing a spatial understanding of the tumor microenvironment.
It identifies interactions between cancer cells, immune cells, and other stromal components.
- **Understanding Metastasis**: By spatially resolving gene expression in metastatic tumors, MERFISH reveals pathways that cancer cells use to invade new tissues.
- **Therapeutic Targeting**: It helps pinpoint specific cell types or molecular pathways for targeted therapies, such as immune checkpoint inhibitors.
#### Infectious Diseases and Immunology
- **Host-Pathogen Interactions**: It helps study how pathogens interact with host cells, revealing spatial patterns of immune activation or suppression.
- **Response to Vaccines**: It helps assess immune responses to vaccines in different tissues by tracking spatial gene expression changes.

## Conclusion
MERFISH exemplifies the evolution of biological research tools, moving beyond standard sequencing to address not just the "what" but also the "where" of gene expression. This spatial resolution allows researchers to explore how cells interact within their native environments and how these interactions change during development, disease, or treatment.
