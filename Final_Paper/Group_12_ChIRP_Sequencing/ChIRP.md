# What is ChIRP-seq?

## Quick Refresher on ChIP-seq:
**ChIP-seq (Chromatin Immunoprecipitation Sequencing)** is a technique that combines chromatin immunoprecipitation with high-throughput DNA sequencing to identify the binding sites of DNA-associated proteins, such as transcription factors or histones, across the genome. It is widely used to study gene regulation, epigenetic modifications, and protein-DNA interactions.

### Steps of ChIP-seq:
1. **Crosslinking**: Cells are treated with formaldehyde to crosslink proteins to DNA, preserving protein-DNA interactions.
2. **Chromatin Fragmentation**: Chromatin is isolated and sheared into smaller fragments, typically by sonication or enzymatic digestion.
3. **Immunoprecipitation**: An antibody specific to the target protein is used to isolate the protein-DNA complexes.
4. **Reversal of Crosslinks**: The crosslinks between protein and DNA are reversed, and the DNA is purified.
5. **Library Preparation and Sequencing**: The DNA fragments are prepared into a sequencing library and subjected to high-throughput sequencing.
6. **Data Analysis**: Sequencing reads are aligned to a reference genome, and peaks are identified to locate protein-DNA interaction sites.

## What is ChIRP-seq?
**ChIRP-seq (Chromatin Isolation by RNA Purification Sequencing)** is very similar to ChIP-seq but is used to analyze RNA-DNA interactions across the genome. This technique identifies the genomic binding sites of specific RNAs, such as long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs), by isolating the DNA-bound RNA molecules and their associated chromatin complexes, followed by high-throughput DNA sequencing. It is often used to gain insights into how RNA molecules regulate gene expression and chromatin architecture.

### Steps of ChIRP-seq:
1. **RNA Capture**: Specific biotin-labeled probes are designed to hybridize to the RNA of interest.
2. **Chromatin Isolation**: Crosslinked chromatin complexes are fragmented.
3. **Pulldown**: The RNA-probe complexes, along with associated DNA and proteins, are captured using streptavidin beads.
4. **DNA Purification**: Crosslinks are reversed, leaving the associated DNA purified.
5. **Sequencing and Analysis**: Purified DNA is sequenced, and the reads are mapped to the genome to identify RNA-DNA interaction sites.
