## Case Study: "Exploration and bioinformatic prediction for profile of mRNA bound to circular RNA BTBD7_hsa_circ_0000563 in coronary artery disease"

This case explored the bioinformatic prediction for the profile of mRNA bound to the circular RNA BTBD7_hsa_circ_0000563. Using an alternative approach, ChIRP-sequencing was used to interrogate these ribonucleoprotein complexes and subsequently employ functional assays to explore how these candidate mRNAs directly impact the disease process. This led to the identification of 221 mRNAs that bound the circular RNA. This case study highlights the power of ChIRP-sequencing to investigate RNA-mediated regulatory networks and downstream pathway effects in association with CAD.

### Key Findings:
1. **Objective**: To investigate the role of the circular RNA BTBD7_hsa_circ_0000563 in coronary artery disease by identifying mRNAs bound to it and analyzing their functional significance in disease progression.
2. **Methodology**:
   - ChIRP-sequencing was used to isolate RNA-chromatin complexes and analyze their regulatory potential.
   - Bioinformatic tools and functional assays identified 221 mRNAs interacting with the circular RNA, showcasing its impact on RNA-mediated regulatory networks.
3. **Visual Data**:
   - **Heatmap**: Highlights clear expression differences between the target and control groups, validating the isolation of specific RNA-binding partners.
   - **Volcano Plot**: Quantifies significantly upregulated mRNAs, providing evidence of RNA-mediated transcriptional regulation.
4. **Impact**:
   - Demonstrates the utility of ChIRP-sequencing in studying RNA-mediated regulatory mechanisms in diseases like CAD.

- Figure 2 shows the differentially expressed genes identified through the ChIRP-Seq. The heatmap provides a qualitative outlook on the RNA binding, the volcano plot shows the quantitative data of the experiment. 
1. **Heatmap**:
   - Visualizes expression differences between BTBD7 circular RNA and control groups.
   - Shows the relative expression levels of mRNAs that were captured by the ChIRP-Seq assay in the target group
   - Each column represents the individual conditions while the rows correspond to a certain gene
   - The red symbolizes upregulation while the blue symbolizes downregulation which is indicative of how much of these mRNAs are present
   - Confirms the successful isolation of RNA-chromatin complexes with minimized background noise.
2. **Volcano Plot**:
   - Displays a subset of significantly upregulated mRNAs among 221 identified targets.
   - P-value is the statistical significance shown compared to the log2 fold changes (magnitude of expression change) for mRNAs
   - On the x-axis, you can see the log2FC (Log2 fold changes) which shows either the upregulation (right) or the downregulation (left) in the target group compared to the control group
   - On the y-axis, it is the -log10P which is representative of the statistical significance of the change
   - Provides quantitative evidence of the circular RNAâ€™s regulatory role in coronary artery disease.

### Implications:
This case study highlights the potential of ChIRP-sequencing in unraveling RNA-mediated regulatory mechanisms. By mapping RNA-chromatin interactions and analyzing their role in regulating gene expression and chromatin dynamics, we are closer to understanding the mechanisms behind diseases and their progression.
