## Application of Isoseq on Micronuclei
From the above discussion we know that IsoSeq enables the study of full-length transcripts, providing valuable insights into RNA splicing and transcriptional disruptions.      
Due to the specific traits of micronuclei, IsoSeq becomes a perfect tool to study micronuclei 

## Understanding Micronuclei
**What are Micronuclei?**   
Micronuclei have a named as "the Lost Chromosomes". It was first discovered in 19th centure by von Hansemann.   
Micronuclei are cytoplasmic structures that contain entire chromosomes or chromosomal fragments. They usually result from errors in segregation during mitosis.   

**Why Study Micronuclei?**   
Micronuclei are key indicators in cancer biology research.     
The exposure of micronuclear chromosome to the cytosolic milieu, through rupture and collapse of the micronuclear envelope during interphase, can raise several pathologic responses which drive tumor progression.

## Mechanisms of Micronuclei Formation
**How did micronulei being produced?**   
Micronuclei arise from mis-segregating events where an entire or a part of a chromosome is left outside of the primary nucleus. And then, the micronucleus ends randomly in one of the daughter cells.  

**The Various Fate of a Micronucleus**

**Fig. 17: Alternative splicing mechanisms**  

a. The micronucleus be reincorporated into the primary nucleus through microtubules correct attachment in mitosis, giving rise to two daughter cells, one aneuploid and one diploid.   
b. The micronucleus  persist in a micronuclear state by mis-segregating again in the subsequent mitosis, forming a diploid daughter cell but micronucleated and an aneuploid daughter cell.   
c. The micronucleus undergo replication and persist in a micronuclear state through mis-segregation, forming two micronucleated, diploid daughter cells.   
d. The micronucleus be extruded from the cell, forming after mitotic division two aneuploid daughter cells that are both missing the micronucleated chromosome.

**Micronuclei functions as the markers of DNA damage. Compared to mitoric figures, its presence  is easier to detect in tissues. As a result, microneclei is a best case to study ongoing mis-segregation. And work as a reliable marker of chromosomal instability.**

## Micronuclei and Cancer
**Micronuceli Rupture**  
Micronuclear rupture is a fundamental step in cancer progression. It can activate immune signaling pathways.

Upon nuclear envelope collapse, the genetic material contained in the micronucleus undergo profound changes and rearrangements.

Due to micronuclear envelope collapse, cytosolic exposure of genetic material initiate the nucleic-acid recognition, and the innate immune cGASâ€“STING pathway and downstream inflammatory signaling.

**Therefore, micronuclei have emerged as a prognostic marker in patients with cancer and as a potential predictor of therapeutic outcome.**  
**By identifying unique splicing events and RNA modifications, IsoSeq helps uncover the molecular mechanisms driven by micronuclei.**
